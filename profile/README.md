# SPLASHYRECORDS

**SPLASHYRECORDS** is an independent label and creative platform built around real artists, real stories, and original music.  
We make tools, spaces, and systems that help artists connect directly with listeners — no middlemen, no noise.

## What We Build

### **SPLASHYRECORDS.com**
The official home for every artist and project under the SPLASHYRECORDS collective.  
Music, visuals, and backstories — all in one place.

### **Splash Club**
A public community for fans, friends, and collaborators.  
Powered by our internal engine **splashBB**, the Club is where members share updates, stories, and behind-the-scenes notes.  
It’s open for anyone to read, and members can join the conversation.

### **splashBB**
The community engine that runs the Splash Club.  
It’s our in-house forum framework built around authenticity, open discussion, and creative exchange.

### **Internal Projects**
We also build tools that help our artists create and release faster — from AI-assisted lyric generation to performance analytics and content automation.

## Guiding Principles

- **Human First:** Every system we build should bring artists and listeners closer together.  
- **Independent Always:** No major label influence. We own our work and our process.  
- **Transparency:** Honest communication, public projects, and a permanent digital archive of everything we create.  
- **Simplicity:** Build only what’s necessary — remove friction, amplify creativity.

## Status

Our music and our software evolve together, one release at a time.  
Stay tuned for updates as we continue expanding the platform, opening up new tools, and sharing what we build along the way.
